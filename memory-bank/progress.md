# Progress and Next Features (Post-Codebase Audit - May 13, 2025)

## Current Project Status
- **Codebase Audit Completed:** All core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been updated to reflect the actual state of the codebase as of May 13, 2025.
- **Next Action:** Proceed with the "Post-Audit Roadmap" outlined in `activeContext.md`. Key immediate priority is integrating the Memory Visualization UI backend with persistent data stores.

## Actually Completed & Implemented Features (Based on Code Audit)

-   **Core Agent Logic (`src/agent.js`):**
    -   CLI for YouTube, GitHub (public/private with PAT), and local project URL/path input.
    -   Orchestration of analysis workflows.
    -   Configuration loading (`config.json`, environment variables).
    -   Basic Express.js backend for Memory UI (currently with mock in-memory data for API).
-   **Content Sourcing:**
    -   YouTube transcript fetching (`src/youtube.js` via `youtube-transcript-plus`).
    -   GitHub repository cloning and content extraction (`src/github.js` via `git` CLI, `glob`, `.agentinclude` support).
    -   Local project content extraction (similar logic in `src/agent.js` and `src/github.js`).
-   **LLM Interaction (`src/llm.js`):**
    -   Interaction with DeepSeek API.
    -   Generation of detailed JSON "Improvement and Re-implementation Blueprints."
    -   Support for follow-up questions/refinements.
-   **Prompt Formatting (`src/promptGenerator.js`):**
    -   Conversion of LLM JSON blueprints to Markdown files and console prompts.
-   **Memory Systems:**
    -   **Simple Key-Value Memory (`src/memory.js`):** File-based (`memory-store.json`).
    -   **Hierarchical Memory (`src/hierarchicalMemory.js`):** File-based for session, project, global layers (`memory-hierarchy/`).
    -   **Semantic Vector Memory (LanceDB):**
        -   OpenAI embedding generation (`vector-memory/embeddingProvider.js`).
        -   LanceDB interface (`src/lancedb.js`) for table creation, data insertion, and vector search.
        -   Higher-level `LanceVectorMemory` class (`vector-memory/lanceVectorMemory.js`) integrating embedding and LanceDB operations.
    -   *(Alternative ChromaDB vector memory implementation also exists in `vector-memory/vectorMemory.js` but LanceDB appears to be the active/primary one based on recent memory bank descriptions before this audit).*
-   **Personalization & Context:**
    -   Developer profile management (`src/developerProfile.js`) storing patterns/preferences in `developer-profiles/`.
    -   Dynamic context window construction for LLMs (`src/contextWindowManager.js`).
-   **Memory Visualization UI (Partial - `src/memory-ui/`):**
    -   React frontend (`App.js`) for browsing, searching, editing memory/profiles.
    -   Backend API in `agent.js` is currently a MOCK and does NOT connect to persistent memory stores.
-   **MCP Client (`src/mcpClient.js`):**
    -   Client for invoking tools on an external MCP server.

## Next Features (Based on Post-Audit Roadmap in `activeContext.md`)

1.  **Memory Visualization UI - Backend Integration:**
    *   **Critical:** Refactor Express API in `agent.js` to connect to and serve data from persistent memory systems (`hierarchicalMemory.js`, `lanceVectorMemory.js`, `developerProfile.js`).
    *   Implement full CRUD API endpoints for these stores.
2.  **Refine Core Agent Workflows & Error Handling:**
    *   Test end-to-end analysis with integrated memory.
    *   Enhance error handling, logging, and user feedback.
3.  **Advanced Contextual Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Design and implement dynamic prompt templates leveraging all memory sources and profiles.
4.  **MCP Tool Integration - YouTube Transcripts:**
    *   Test and enable MCP client for YouTube transcript fetching if a reliable server is available.
5.  **Knowledge Graph Updates (Post-Audit):**
    *   Review and update KG based on any significant new findings from the audit (if not already covered by initial KG setup).

## What Is Still Left / Not Yet Fully Implemented or Verified (Post-Audit)

This list reflects features that are either not started, partially implemented without full integration, or need significant refinement based on the current codebase understanding.

-   **Memory Visualization UI - Full Functionality:** The UI backend is currently mocked. Full CRUD operations against persistent memory are NOT implemented for the UI.
-   **Advanced Agent Autonomy & Task Chaining:** No system for breaking down high-level goals or autonomous task execution.
-   **Sophisticated Prompt Engineering:** Current prompt generation is template-based; advanced dynamic adaptation using full context (semantic search, hierarchical memory, profiles) is a next step.
-   **Robust MCP Tool Usage:** MCP client exists, but its practical application (e.g., for YouTube transcripts) is not fully integrated or prioritized.
-   **Comprehensive Testing Framework:** No automated testing, validation, or evaluation framework for agent outputs or module integrations.
-   **Cloud/Server Deployment & Multi-User Support:** Agent is CLI-focused; no infrastructure for cloud deployment or multi-user scenarios.
-   **Security/Access Control:** No specific authentication/authorization beyond GitHub PATs for private repos.
-   **In-depth Documentation/Help System:** While Memory Bank exists, no in-agent help or comprehensive user guides.
-   **Extensive External API Integrations (beyond core):** Limited to DeepSeek, OpenAI, YouTube (via library), and GitHub (via CLI).
-   **Performance Optimization for Scale:** Current implementations are functional but not necessarily optimized for very large datasets or high-throughput scenarios.
-   **Alternative ChromaDB Vector Memory:** Its current status and integration level relative to LanceDB need clarification if it's intended for future use.

**Summary (Post-Audit):**
The AI Agent has a strong foundation with multiple analysis capabilities, sophisticated memory systems (including functional LanceDB semantic search), developer personalization, and a partially implemented Memory UI. The immediate focus post-audit is to make the Memory UI fully functional by connecting its backend to the persistent data stores, followed by enhancing the agent's intelligence through advanced contextual prompt engineering. The Memory Bank documentation is now significantly more aligned with the actual codebase.
