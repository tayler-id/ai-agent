# Progress and Next Features

## Recently Completed
- Hierarchical memory (session, project, global) with persistent storage.
- Dynamic context window management for LLM input.
- Personalized contextual profiles: developer ID, coding patterns, preferences.
- Profile-aware LLM context and incremental profile learning.

## Next 5 Features (Planned)

1. **Vector Database (VectorDB) Integration for Semantic Memory Retrieval**
2. **Active Memory Visualization and Editing UI**
3. **Automated Contextual Prompt Engineering**
4. **Agent Autonomy and Task Chaining**
5. **Plugin/Tooling Ecosystem for External Integrations**

## What Is Left / Not Yet Implemented

Below is a summary of major features and enhancements that are still pending or only partially implemented, based on the original roadmap and recent planning:

- **Vector Database (VectorDB) Integration:** No semantic search or embedding-based retrieval is present yet. All memory retrieval is keyword-based and hierarchical.
- **Memory Visualization UI:** There is no web or CLI UI for browsing, editing, or tagging memory or profiles.
- **Automated Prompt Engineering:** Prompts are static or template-based; no adaptive or profile-driven prompt generation is implemented.
- **Agent Autonomy:** The agent does not break down high-level goals into subtasks or chain actions autonomously.
- **Plugin/Tooling Ecosystem:** No plugin system for external tools, APIs, or custom LLM endpoints.
- **Advanced Profile Adaptation:** Profiles are updated with coding patterns, but there is no deep learning from developer behavior, no preference inference, and no advanced adaptation.
- **Semantic Code/Doc Search:** No code/documentation embedding or semantic search for relevant context.
- **Cloud/Server Deployment:** The agent is CLI-only and not packaged for cloud, web, or API deployment.
- **Multi-user/Team Support:** No support for multiple users, team memory, or collaborative workflows.
- **Notifications/Proactive Suggestions:** The agent does not proactively suggest actions, improvements, or notify users of relevant memory.
- **Task Manager Integration:** No integration with external or internal task managers for tracking, prioritizing, or revisiting tasks.
- **Testing/Validation Framework:** No automated testing, validation, or evaluation of agent outputs.
- **Security/Access Control:** No authentication, authorization, or access control for memory, profiles, or agent actions.
- **Documentation/Help System:** No in-app documentation, onboarding, or help system for new users.
- **Extensive API Integrations:** Only basic GitHub and YouTube support; no integrations with other dev tools, APIs, or cloud services.
- **Performance Optimization:** No caching, batching, or optimization for large-scale memory or multi-agent scenarios.
- **Mobile/Web Companion:** No mobile or web companion app for remote access or notifications.
- **Customizable Workflows:** No workflow scripting, automation, or user-defined pipelines.
- **Analytics/Usage Insights:** No analytics, reporting, or insights into agent usage, memory growth, or developer patterns.

**Summary:**  
While the agent now supports hierarchical memory, dynamic context, and basic profile learning, most advanced features from the original roadmap (semantic search, UI, autonomy, plugins, cloud, etc.) are still left to build. These are documented here for ongoing tracking and prioritization.
