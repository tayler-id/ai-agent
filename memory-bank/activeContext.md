# Active Context: Post-Codebase Audit & Refined Roadmap

## Current Status: Codebase Audit Completed (May 13, 2025)

- **Objective:** To gain an accurate understanding of the current AI Agent codebase, its features, architecture, and technologies, and to update all Memory Bank documents accordingly.
- **Process:**
    1. Identified key source files in `src/` and `vector-memory/`.
    2. Read and analyzed the content of these core modules.
    3. Determined the current system architecture, implemented features, and technologies in use.
    4. Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to reflect these findings.
- **Outcome:** The Memory Bank (project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context) now accurately represents the project's current state. This provides a solid foundation for planning future work.

## Immediate Next Steps (Post-Audit Roadmap)

Based on the comprehensive codebase audit and the updated understanding of the project's capabilities and architecture, the following are the immediate priorities:

1.  **Investigate and Fix Local Path Analysis Bug (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
    *   **Issue:** User reported that local path analysis is not working.
    *   **Objective:** Identify the root cause of the failure in local path analysis and implement a robust fix.
    *   **Debugging Strategy (Initial):**
        *   Add detailed logging within `src/agent.js` in the section handling local paths (where `isLocalPath` is true). Log the detected path, parameters passed to `getRepoContentForAnalysis`, and the returned content or error.
        *   Add detailed logging within `src/github.js` inside `getRepoContentForAnalysis`, specifically for conditions where it's processing a local directory. Log file scanning, content extraction attempts, and errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Implement necessary code changes in `src/agent.js` and/or `src/github.js`.
    *   **Testing:** Test with various local path scenarios after the fix.
    *   **Documentation:** Update Memory Bank if the fix alters functionality.
    *   **Version Control:** Commit and push the fix.

2.  **Memory Visualization UI - Backend Integration (Following Local Path Fix):**
    *   **Critical:** The current Express API backend for the Memory Visualization UI (`src/agent.js`) uses in-memory mock data. This needs to be refactored to connect to and serve data from the actual persistent memory systems:
        *   `src/hierarchicalMemory.js` (for session, project, global layers).
        *   `vector-memory/lanceVectorMemory.js` (for semantic search results, potentially listing entries).
        *   `src/developerProfile.js` (for developer profiles).
    *   Implement API endpoints in `src/agent.js` (or a dedicated API module) for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete where applicable) on these persistent memory stores, to be consumed by the React UI (`src/memory-ui/src/App.js`).

3.  **Refine Core Agent Workflows & Error Handling:**
    *   Thoroughly test the end-to-end analysis workflows (YouTube, GitHub, local path) with the integrated memory systems.
    *   Enhance error handling, logging, and user feedback across all modules for robustness.
    *   Ensure consistent use of `developerId` and `projectId` (if applicable) when interacting with memory systems.

4.  **Advanced Contextual Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Begin designing and implementing more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques in `src/promptGenerator.js` and `src/llm.js`.
    *   Leverage the full spectrum of available context:
        *   Semantic search results from LanceDB.
        *   Relevant entries from hierarchical memory (session, project, global).
        *   Developer profile preferences and coding patterns.
    *   Develop dynamic prompt templates that adapt to the specific task and available context.

5.  **MCP Tool Integration - YouTube Transcripts:**
    *   Revisit and test the commented-out MCP client integration in `src/youtube.js` for fetching transcripts. If a reliable MCP server providing this tool is available, enable and prioritize its use.

## Ongoing Documentation & Knowledge Management
-   All new features, module changes, and architectural decisions will continue to be documented in the Memory Bank.
-   The Knowledge Graph will be updated as the system evolves.
-   The Memory Visualization UI, once its backend is integrated, will become a key tool for monitoring and curating the agent's knowledge.

This refined roadmap, informed by the detailed codebase audit, ensures that development efforts are focused on the most impactful areas, particularly making the existing Memory UI functional with real data and then leveraging the rich memory systems for better AI assistance.
