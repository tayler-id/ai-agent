# Active Context: Next Steps for ai-agent

## Immediate Next Steps (Implementation Roadmap)

1. **Vector Database (VectorDB) Integration**
   - Research and select a suitable vector database (e.g., Chroma, Weaviate, Pinecone, or a local embedding store).
   - Implement embedding generation for memory entries, code snippets, and documentation (using OpenAI, HuggingFace, or local models).
   - Integrate semantic search for context retrieval, replacing or augmenting keyword-based memory lookups.
   - Update agent flow to use semantic retrieval for LLM context assembly.

2. **Memory Visualization and Editing UI**
   - Design a simple CLI or web-based UI for browsing, searching, and editing memory and developer profiles.
   - Implement features for tagging, deleting, and curating memory entries.
   - Add visualization for memory layers (session, project, global) and vector search results.

3. **Automated Contextual Prompt Engineering**
   - Develop a prompt generator module that adapts LLM prompts based on developer profile, project type, and recent memory.
   - Implement prompt templates and dynamic slot-filling for different agent tasks (e.g., code review, refactoring, documentation).
   - Test and refine prompt adaptation for improved LLM output quality.

4. **Agent Autonomy and Task Chaining**
   - Build a task manager/planner module for breaking down high-level goals into subtasks.
   - Enable the agent to execute subtasks in sequence, updating memory and progress after each.
   - Integrate with the existing memory and profile system for context-aware planning.

5. **Plugin/Tooling Ecosystem**
   - Design a plugin architecture for registering and invoking external tools, APIs, and custom LLM endpoints.
   - Implement a plugin manager for configuration, discovery, and execution of plugins.
   - Document plugin development and integration process for users.

## Ongoing Documentation

- All new features, modules, and architectural changes will be documented in the Memory Bank (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, etc.) and the project README.
- Each milestone will include a summary of what was built, how it works, and what is left to do.

---

## How to Proceed

- Begin with VectorDB integration, as it will unlock semantic memory and improve all downstream features.
- After each feature is implemented, update documentation and test the agentâ€™s new capabilities.
- Use the Memory Visualization UI to validate and curate memory as the agent evolves.
- Continue to iterate on prompt engineering and autonomy, guided by user feedback and real-world usage.

This roadmap ensures the agent will evolve toward a robust, adaptive, and extensible developer assistant, with clear documentation and incremental progress at every stage.
