1. Understand the project's core purpose: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification defines a JSON-RPC based protocol for communication between clients and servers in AI/LLM ecosystems, enabling features like resource management, tool calling, prompt templating, and model sampling.
2. Identify and list the core features: JSON-RPC 2.0 based communication protocol; Resource management (listing, reading, subscribing); Prompt templating and management; Tool calling with schema definitions; Model sampling with preferences; Progress notifications; Pagination support; Logging capabilities; Autocomplete functionality.
3. Analyze the technology stack: TypeScript (primary schema definition); JSON Schema (for compatibility); Mintlify (documentation); Node.js (tooling and validation).
4. Develop a build strategy for a similar tool, considering these points: Start with core JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation; Define clear capability negotiation (client/server); Implement resource management system first; Add tool calling framework with schema validation; Develop prompt templating system; Implement model sampling with preference handling; Add notification system for real-time updates.
5. Brainstorm potential improvements or alternative features based on: Add more comprehensive error handling documentation; Include examples of protocol usage in different scenarios; Expand authentication/security considerations; Add more detailed versioning strategy; Include performance optimization guidelines.
6. Based on the above, draft an initial plan or a set of user stories for building a similar or improved version of this tool.
7. What are the key challenges or risks in developing such a tool?
