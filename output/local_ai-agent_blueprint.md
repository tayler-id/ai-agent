# Improvement & Re-implementation Blueprint for Local Project: D:\Dev\ai-agent

## Original Project Summary
### Purpose
To create a versatile command-line tool that automates the process of understanding and deriving insights from YouTube videos and GitHub repositories using AI (LLMs) to extract key information and generate useful outputs like coding prompts.

### Core Mechanics/Concepts
- URL type detection and routing (YouTube vs GitHub)
- Content extraction from GitHub repositories (cloning, file selection, concatenation)
- Transcript fetching from YouTube videos
- LLM interaction for content analysis
- Blueprint generation for improvement/reimplementation
- Interactive follow-up Q&A system

## Suggested Enhanced Version
### Concept for Enhancement
A more extensible and robust AI content analysis platform with plugin architecture, multi-LLM support, and advanced collaboration features for team use.

### Key Enhancements & Actionable Steps
#### 1. Plugin Architecture for Content Sources
**Description:** Implement a plugin system to support additional content sources beyond YouTube and GitHub (e.g., web articles, PDFs, documentation sites).
**Reasoning:** Makes the tool more versatile and future-proof by allowing easy addition of new content types without core modifications.
**Actionable Steps for Coding Agent:**
  - Define plugin interface with standard methods (detect, extract, preprocess)
  - Create plugin registration system in core
  - Implement YouTube and GitHub as first-party plugins
  - Add plugin configuration in config.json
  - Document plugin development process
**Builds upon/replaces:** Current hardcoded URL handling in agent.js, Content extraction logic in github.js and youtube.js

#### 2. Multi-LLM Support with Fallback
**Description:** Add support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) with automatic fallback if primary fails.
**Reasoning:** Reduces dependency on single provider and allows leveraging different LLM strengths for different tasks.
**Actionable Steps for Coding Agent:**
  - Create LLM provider interface
  - Implement DeepSeek, OpenAI and Anthropic providers
  - Add provider selection and fallback logic
  - Update config system for multiple API keys
  - Add provider-specific prompt tuning
**Builds upon/replaces:** Current DeepSeek-only implementation in llm.js, Single API key configuration

#### 3. Team Collaboration Features
**Description:** Add features for team use including shared analysis history, comments on blueprints, and voting on enhancements.
**Reasoning:** Makes the tool more valuable for organizational use where multiple stakeholders need to collaborate on technical analysis.
**Actionable Steps for Coding Agent:**
  - Design database schema for shared artifacts
  - Implement user authentication system
  - Create API endpoints for collaboration features
  - Build UI components for comments/voting
  - Add team management to configuration
**Builds upon/replaces:** Current single-user focus, Local file output system

### Suggested Tech Stack for Enhanced Version
- Node.js (current core, maintain for CLI)
- Fastify (for new API endpoints)
- PostgreSQL (for team features data)
- TypeScript (for better maintainability)
- Vite/React (for optional web interface)
- LangChain (for multi-LLM abstraction)

### Critical Files to Create/Modify for Enhanced Version
- src/plugins/pluginInterface.js (new)
- src/llm/providers/ (new directory for multi-LLM)
- server/api/ (new directory for collaboration API)
- src/sharedModels/ (new directory for DB models)
- config.json (needs expansion for new features)

### Suggested Boilerplate Code
```typescript
// Example plugin interface
export interface ContentPlugin {
  name: string;
  canHandle(url: string): boolean;
  extractContent(url: string): Promise<string>;
  preprocess?(content: string): string;
}

// Example implementation for web articles
export class WebArticlePlugin implements ContentPlugin {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### Gap Analysis & Competitive Advantages
- No persistence layer for analysis history
- Limited error handling for edge cases
- No performance metrics collection
- Lack of automated tests
- Minimal documentation for extension
