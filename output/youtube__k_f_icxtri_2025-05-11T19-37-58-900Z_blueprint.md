# Improvement & Re-implementation Blueprint for YouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K_F_icxtrI

## Original Project Summary
### Purpose
To leverage AI as a core operating system for businesses, enabling exponential growth through the 'master prompt method' which provides detailed context and protocols for AI to act as a strategic partner.

### Core Mechanics/Concepts
- Master Prompt Method: A comprehensive, context-rich prompt that guides AI interactions based on business-specific data and protocols.
- AI Protocols: Pre-defined triggers (e.g., 'AI hiring', 'AI SOP') that activate specific workflows within the master prompt.
- Contextual Knowledge Base: Integration of business details (team structure, products, culture) into AI interactions for personalized outputs.

## Suggested Enhanced Version
### Concept for Enhancement
A web-based 'Master Prompt Builder' platform that allows businesses to create, manage, and share master prompts with their teams, integrating with AI tools like Claude and Notebook LM.

### Key Enhancements & Actionable Steps
#### 1. Interactive Master Prompt Editor
**Description:** A user-friendly interface for creating and editing master prompts with sections for personal info, company details, team structure, products, and culture. Includes AI-assisted suggestions for filling out sections.
**Reasoning:** Simplifies the process of creating comprehensive master prompts, making it accessible to non-technical users and ensuring all critical business context is captured.
**Actionable Steps for Coding Agent:**
  - Design a React-based UI with a form for each master prompt section (personal, company, team, etc.).
  - Implement AI-assisted suggestions using Claude API to help users fill out sections (e.g., 'Help me define our ideal customer profile').
  - Add a preview mode to see how the master prompt will be structured for the AI.
  - Include validation to ensure all critical sections are populated before saving.
**Builds upon/replaces:** Hayden describes manually creating a 30-page Google doc for the master prompt, which is then copied into Claude's preferences., The need to iteratively update the master prompt based on AI interactions is mentioned.

#### 2. Team Collaboration Features
**Description:** Enable sharing and collaborative editing of master prompts across teams, with permission controls for sensitive information.
**Reasoning:** Facilitates alignment across teams and ensures everyone is working with the same business context, while protecting sensitive data.
**Actionable Steps for Coding Agent:**
  - Implement user accounts with role-based access (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
  - Create a sharing system where master prompts can be shared with specific team members or groups.
  - Add commenting/feedback features for collaborative refinement of prompts.
  - Include version history to track changes and revert if needed.
**Builds upon/replaces:** Hayden mentions sharing master prompts with leadership teams and the need to update them collaboratively., The challenge of siloing certain information (e.g., buyer vs. seller side data) is discussed.

#### 3. Protocol Library & Templates
**Description:** A repository of pre-built AI protocols (like 'AI hiring' or 'AI SOP') that users can customize for their business.
**Reasoning:** Accelerates adoption by providing proven starting points for common business workflows, while allowing customization.
**Actionable Steps for Coding Agent:**
  - Create a database of common protocols with fields for triggers, expected inputs, and output formats.
  - Implement a search/filter system to help users find relevant protocols.
  - Add a 'forking' system where users can copy and adapt existing protocols.
  - Include ratings/feedback to surface the most effective protocols.
**Builds upon/replaces:** The video demonstrates specific protocols like 'AI hiring' and 'AI SOP' that could be templatized., Hayden mentions iterating on these protocols over time to improve them.

### Suggested Tech Stack for Enhanced Version
- React (frontend framework for interactive UI)
- Node.js/Express (backend API)
- Claude API (AI integration)
- MongoDB (document storage for master prompts and protocols)
- Firebase Authentication (user management)

### Critical Files to Create/Modify for Enhanced Version
- src/components/MasterPromptEditor.js (main prompt creation interface)
- src/api/claudeIntegration.js (handles AI interactions)
- src/models/ProtocolTemplate.js (data structure for protocol templates)
- src/features/collaboration/SharingManager.js (handles team sharing logic)
